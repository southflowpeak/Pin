#### 💡 Why is Screen Recording permission required?

Pin uses macOS's **ScreenCaptureKit API** to keep windows on top:

1. **SCStream** captures the target window's content in real-time
2. The captured frames are displayed using **AVSampleBufferDisplayLayer**
3. This layer is placed in a floating window set to `NSWindow.Level.floating`

This creates a "mirror window" that stays on top even when the original window is behind other windows. Since ScreenCaptureKit is used to capture window content, macOS requires Screen Recording permission.

## 🚀 Usage

1. Click the 📌 icon in the menu bar
2. Select "Pin Window..." and choose the window you want to pin
3. To unpin, click the pin icon on the top-left of the mirror window, or select "Unpin" from the menu
